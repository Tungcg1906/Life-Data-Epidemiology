## Project: Human mobility and COVID-19 epidemic

This project is divided into 3 parts:

#### 1. Exploration of the Relationship between Mobility Patterns and the Dissemination of COVID-19:
Investigating the impact of restrictions and health advisories on the outbreak dynamics, this phase aims to discern the intricate interplay between human mobility and the transmission of COVID-19. The analysis will shed light on the effectiveness of implemented measures in curbing the spread of the virus.

#### 2. Calculation of the Reproductive Ratio Rt and Comparative Analysis with Empirical Data:
This stage involves the computation of the Reproductive Ratio (Rt) as a crucial epidemiological metric. The calculated Rt will be systematically compared against real-world data, providing insights into the alignment of theoretical models with observed patterns in the spread of COVID-19. This comparative analysis contributes to the validation and refinement of our predictive models.

#### 3. Application of Statistical Methodology (ARIMA) for COVID-19 Spread Prediction in Italian Regions:
Leveraging the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) statistical method, this phase aims to predict the future trajectory of COVID-19 spread within the regions of Italy. The application of ARIMA provides a rigorous and data-driven approach to forecasting, contributing valuable insights for strategic planning and response efforts.
